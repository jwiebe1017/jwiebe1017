### Hello, it's me  
### I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet  
### To go over my projects... 😉  

Most of the repositories in here are to get a sense of how I usually approach and architect projects.   
I love exploring current trends in data parsing, machine learning/model hosting, and generally try to improve my own techniques.  

- 🪐 I studied astrophysics as CU Boulder
- 🤔 Medium + O'Reilly are my usual places for inspiration and demonstration of concepts
- 👹 I'm a big fan of horror, heavy metal, photography, tattoos, and more!
